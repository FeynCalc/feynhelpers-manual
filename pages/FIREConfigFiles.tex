\texttt{FIREConfigFiles} is an option for \texttt{FIREBurn}. It
specifies, where the three files that contain all the FIRE configuration
are saved.

The first file contains the lists of loop momenta, external momenta and
propagators. Normally it ends with the FIRE command \texttt{SaveStart}.

The second file loads the .start file that was generated previously and
reduces the given loop integrals.

Finally, the third file contains replacement rules for the introduced
abbreviations. The default location of these files is the
\texttt{Database} folder inside \texttt{\$FeynCalcDirectory}.
